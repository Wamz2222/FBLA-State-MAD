# KHS FBLA
---
Our app is designed to help students in the King High School FBLA chapter in various ways. It gives a way for all students to learn about what FBLA is, join FBLA, see a calendar of all events, learn about the current officer team, learn about all the competitive events, read common questions and answers, contact the FBLA team, and links to the Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram pages for the FBLA Florida Chapter. It also gives the opportunity for leadership members to log in and mark the attendance for all chapter members for each individual meeting.
